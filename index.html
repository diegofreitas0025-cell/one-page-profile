    <h1>Profile Website</h1>

    <p>Hi there,</p>

    <p>
      I'm looking for a Web Designer to collaborate with me on designing a 1 page website for the following profile website:
    </p>

    <p>Currently in plain text.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://limewire.com/d/7b9c3#QB24iyTnRT" target="_blank">
        https://limewire.com/d/7b9c3#QB24iyTnRT
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      My theme is that of isolative Darkness; with the awe of innumerable moments of utter brightness of Light.
      In the format of a 1 page scrollable website; ala. a social media feed.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm looking for people who are passionate about collaboration and developing long term relationships in their careers & even friendships.
      This isn't just about a deliverable & a monetary gain.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your process is to be hands off. Do your work., and then deliver it. Then this isn't for you.
    </p>
